Hi, I'm sarah seo. This is the first post of this blog.

To tell the current status of the app, I'm currently refactoring the database apis. This work should be finished before releasing because modifying cost of this part is so high.
After then, I'm going to publish this app to `brew`, `scoop` and `snap`.
I think this would be done within this month, January.

Please a little wait more.
